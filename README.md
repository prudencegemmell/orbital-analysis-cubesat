# üõ∞Ô∏è Orbital Decay and Ground Coverage Analysis of a CubeSat

## Overview
This project explores how a CubeSat's orbital parameters, specifically altitude and inclination, affect its mission profile. We simulate satellite orbits using Systems Tool Kit (STK) and analyze access windows, orbital decay, and ground track coverage with Python. The goal is to build a bridge between orbital mechanics, physics principles, and data analysis while producing visual, interpretable results.

## Motivation
Small satellite missions must carefully balance orbital lifespan, ground visibility, and energy efficiency. This project aims to simulate and visualize these trade-offs, offering a practical demonstration of how space mission planning integrates physics and data science.

## Objectives
- Simulate low Earth orbits (LEO) at various altitudes and inclinations
- Estimate orbital decay timeframes due to atmospheric drag
- Analyze satellite visibility over a ground station
- Compare revisit times and coverage for different orbital parameters
- Visualize ground tracks and coverage maps

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: data analysis, visualization
  - Libraries: `Skyfield`, `Poliastro`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`
- **STK (Systems Tool Kit)**: industry-standard simulation and visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: interactive data exploration
