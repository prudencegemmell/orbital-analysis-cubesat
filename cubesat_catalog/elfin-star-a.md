# 🛰️ ELFIN-STAR A

**NORAD ID**: 43693  
**Inclination**: 97.59°  
**Orbit Type**: Sun-synchronous LEO  
**Mission Type**: Space Weather

## 🔍 Mission Overview

ELFIN-STAR A is part of the ELFIN (Electron Losses and Fields Investigation) mission developed by UCLA. Its primary goal is to investigate the dynamics of Earth’s radiation belts, particularly how energetic electrons precipitate into the upper atmosphere during geomagnetic storms.

By understanding particle loss mechanisms from the Van Allen belts, ELFIN helps model how solar activity affects near-Earth space — with implications for satellites, astronauts, and atmospheric chemistry.

## 🚀 Key Science Objectives

- Measure electron precipitation events
- Correlate data with solar wind and geomagnetic activity
- Contribute to radiation belt modeling and magnetospheric physics
