# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks developed for the CubeSat Orbital Analysis project. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of CubeSat orbital dynamics or comparison.

## Notebook Overview

### 1. `orbital_analysis.ipynb`
A foundational notebook that explores orbital inclination using live TLE data. It includes visualizations and inclination classification.

### 2. `inclination_sorting_analysis.ipynb`
Refines the analysis by grouping CubeSats into inclination categories (equatorial, mid-inclination, polar, retrograde), allowing for easier filtering and exploration.

### 3. `comparison_cubesat_iss_starlink.ipynb`
A side-by-side orbital comparison of a CubeSat with well-known satellites like the ISS and Starlink, highlighting differences in altitude, path shape, and coverage.

---

Each notebook builds toward the development of an interactive CubeSat dashboard and deeper orbital modeling.
